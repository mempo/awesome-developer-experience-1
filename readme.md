If you value the experienced team you have, consider working on what’s called the developer experience to keep them eager and comfortable.                                                                                           | Marek Gajda       | 3/26/2021  |

They did this by recognizing the importance of the developer experience, executing on it, and by marketing to developers.                                                                                                                                                | Sean Falconer     | 11/16/2020 |

Because DX is a strand within UX, that is developers who use your product, even if extremely technical users, are still users who will be impacted if your product has a bad UX.                                                                                                                                                  | Albert Cavalcante | 5/11/2020  |

One of the best answers to that question is: Focus on creating a dedicated developer experience team that can empower your users by making it easier to understand, easier to build, and easier to integrate (particularly if your company develops customer-facing APIs).                                                   | James Messinger   | 3/11/2020  |

Product managers, marketers, and engineers alike have an interest in evaluating and improving how a developer uses their technical product.                                                                                                                                                          | Adam DuVander     | 10/1/2019  |
| [The Best Practices for a Great Developer Experience (DX)](https://hackernoon.com/the-best-practices-for-a-great-developer-experience-dx-9036834382b0)        | Developer Experience (DX) is the equivalent to User Experience (UX) when the user of the software or system is a developer. DX describes the experience developers have when they use your product, be it client libraries, SDKs, frameworks, open source code, tools, API, technology or service. DX shares some ideas and philosophies from UX design (or HCI), but builds on these with an eye towards modern technology and standards. | Sam Jarman        | 10/6/2017  |
| [Building a Developer Experience Team at Sendgrid](https://sendgrid.com/blog/scaling-product-management-at-sendgrid-building-a-developer-experience-team)     | As we scaled up to hundreds of employees, many new PMs, designers, and engineers ended up working on the product who didn’t share that same explicit understanding of our developer customers. Slowly, but surely, the overall DX around SendGrid suffered.                                                                                                                                                                                | Scott Williamson  | 4/12/2017  |

It can help increase programmers’ efficience and make it easier for developers to achieve goals on behalf of end users.                                                                                                                                                         | Sergio De Simone  | 10/25/2015 |

Its features satisfied basic needs and also inspired ideas of what could be done when the Internet was always in your pocket. Eight months later, Apple made the iOS SDK available, transforming the iPhone from a product into a platform.                                                                                                           | Jeremiah Lee      | 3/24/2011  |
